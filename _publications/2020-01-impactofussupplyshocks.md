excerpt: 'This study uses a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model to show that U.S. shale oil supply shocks significantly impacted global oil prices, accounting for up to 13% of the price variation between 2003 and 2015â€”more than previously found. However, despite increased U.S. production since 2010, these supply shocks only began lowering prices in late 2013, suggesting temporary transmission frictions likely due to logistical and technological challenges in the downstream supply chain.'

I examine the role of the U.S. shale oil boom in driving global oil prices. Using a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model that identifies separate oil supply shocks for the U.S. and OPEC, I find that U.S. supply shocks can account for up to 13% of the oil price variation over the 2003-2015 period. This is considerably more than what has been found in other studies. Moreover, while U.S. oil production has increased substantially since 2010, U.S. oil supply shocks first started to contribute negatively to oil prices beginning in late 2013. This mismatch implies a temporary friction in the transmission of U.S. supply shocks to the rest of the world likely caused by logistical and technological challenges observed in the downstream supply chain.
